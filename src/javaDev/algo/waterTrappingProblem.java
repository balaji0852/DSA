//    q12. water trapping problem.
//
//    given a array of values consider as index as x axis and the values as y axis, find the amount of water that can be trapped between each wells formed.
//
//    sol. Formula to find amount of water that can be stored in a index is min(leftMax,rightMax)-index -height. This can be approached in two different ways.
//        1. By calculating and storing, left max and right max of each index and calculating the result(this approach requires two loops, to obtain the left
//            max and right maxâ€™s). 2. By using two pointer method. having left and right max with the two pointer, if leftmax<rightmax, then amount of water
//    storage in that well is leftmax-height[curIndex] else rightmax-height[curIndex].
